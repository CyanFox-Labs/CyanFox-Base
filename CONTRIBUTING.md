# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Always make a new branch for your work.
- Make sure your code has adequate comments explaining what your code is meant to do.
- Make sure your code passes all tests.
- Do not add any lib files in the PR.
- Check your code for any conflicts with the main branch before creating a PR.
- Make sure you use meaningful commit messages.
- Do not leave unnecessary blank lines or spaces.
- Do not commit any files that are not related to your task.
- Do not copy and paste code. Understand the logic behind it and implement it.
- Always pull the latest changes from the upstream/main before pushing anything to the main repository.
- If you are tasked to work on a feature that someone else is already working on, try collaborating with them.

## Creating a Pull Request:

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all the instructions and rules mentioned above.
2. Fork the project, clone your fork to your machine, and add this repository as an upstream.
3. Pull the latest changes from upstream to your local.
4. Create a new branch with a meaningful name.
5. Add the files you changed with clear and concise comments explaining the changes.
6. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
7. Push your changes to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to the upstream repository.
9. Give your pull request a meaningful title and a clear description about what your PR is for and why it should be merged into the main repository.
10. Wait for the PR to be reviewed by the maintainers. Make changes to the PR if the maintaining team asks for them.
11. After your PR is merged, remember to pull the latest changes from the original (upstream) repository to your local repository and delete your branch if it is no longer needed.

Once your PR gets merged, you are officially a contributor!
